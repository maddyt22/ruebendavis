                    <p>Working with Rueben on my promotional video for my art exhibition, Rhythmic Landscapes was fun
                        and seamless.

                        I gave him a rough brief of what I was thinking of. He suggested locations where he thought
                        would best suit my story, he filmed in different formats, edited graphics and added my voice
                        over. All with an amazing creative flair but still in an professional way. I was over the moon
                        with the final product.

                        The video was used throughout my social media campaign and had great success with bringing many
                        collectors to view my artworks.

                    While shooting my short film ‘A Moment’. I had Rueben do behind the scenes photo stills on the day.
                    The result.. AMAZING. Such an amazing eye for subject matter. He also helped me create the posters
                    for the film. Again, the creative process of that felt fun, effortless and awesome. Being open
                    minded to ideas and also chime in some of his own, blending together to create the best product
                    possible. Plus he’s just a top bloke as well! I can’t wait to work with him next.</p>
